Polymorphism:
      Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
      In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
      The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.
      
Example
       Lets consider a person who is working in the company so he is an employee,the same person who is son of his parent.
       the same person have different roles in his life which is called polymorphism.
      
Encapsulation:
       It describes the concept of bundling data and methods within a single unit.
       So, for example, when you create a class, it means you are implementing encapsulation.
       A class is an example of encapsulation as it binds all the data members (instance variables) and methods into a single unit.
          
Data Abstraction:
      Abstraction is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. 
      This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.
      
      Example 
            bank account system
