# Python
#There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways
you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) 
def Ways(x):
    return fib(x+1)
x = int(input())
print(Ways(x))
